# File integrity verificator

University project which goal is to implement RSA cryptosystem to generate PKCS compliant digital signature of a file. It uses a video file, provided by the user, as an entropy source and randomly searches for 512-bit prime numbers with Miler Rabin test.

This program allows to both generate digital signature and to verify file integrity.
